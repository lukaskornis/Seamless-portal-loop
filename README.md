# Non-Euclidean Wormhole Demo

This Unity3D experiment explores seamless, non-Euclidean level transitions using C#.
The goal is to eliminate loading screens and immersion-breaking portals by creating the illusion of continuous, impossible spaces.

## Concept

The demo features a rolling ball that appears to travel endlessly through a pipe. From the playerâ€™s first-person perspective, the ball never stops and the environment feels infinite.

Behind the scenes, when the ball reaches the end of the pipe, it is instantly teleported back to the beginning with its position, angle, and rotation precisely matched. This creates a convincing illusion of infinite space without any visual discontinuities.
